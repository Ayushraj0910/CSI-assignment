# 🧠 MNIST Denoising Autoencoder

A deep learning project that removes noise from handwritten digit images using **Autoencoders**, trained and evaluated on the **MNIST** dataset using **PyTorch**.

---

## ✨ Features

- 📥 Loads and preprocesses the MNIST dataset
- 🎲 Adds artificial Gaussian noise to handwritten digit images
- 🧠 Trains **three different Autoencoder architectures**
- 📊 Compares reconstruction performance across models
- 🖼️ Visualizes **Original → Noisy → Denoised** images
- 💾 Automatically saves trained model weights

## 🚀 Autoencoder Architectures

| Model | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **FFNN Autoencoder** | Simple fully connected encoder-decoder network |
| **Transpose CNN Autoencoder** | Convolutional encoder with transposed convolution decoder |
| **Upsampled CNN Autoencoder** | Convolutional encoder with nearest-neighbor upsampling and convolution decoder |

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Python **3.8+**
- PyTorch
- Torchvision
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib
```

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Open **`autoencoder_mnist.ipynb`** in:
   - Jupyter Notebook
   - JupyterLab
   - VS Code

2. Run all notebook cells from top to bottom.

3. The **MNIST dataset** is downloaded automatically during the first run.

4. Model weights (`.pth`) are saved automatically after training.

5. Training all three models for **20 epochs** takes only a few minutes on CPU and is significantly faster on GPU.

> **No manual dataset download is required.** Everything is handled automatically.

## 📈 Results

The notebook concludes with an **Observations & Analysis** section containing:

- Validation loss comparison for all three models
- Visual comparison of denoised outputs
- Performance discussion
- Challenges encountered during training
